# merger
Merging dynamic source content to html templates by data configuration (mapping)

Objectives are:
1) to keep html separate from code so that it easier to understand and maintain.
2) to keep content separate from the html.
3) to use configured json data to map source content to target html sections, elements and attributes.
4) to facilitate the composing of dynamic web pages with minimal additional coding.
5) to allow the code and mappings to function equally in NodeJS or Browser
